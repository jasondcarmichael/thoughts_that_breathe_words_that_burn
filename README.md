# thoughts_that_breathe_words_that_burn

## Description
A searchable webpage devoted to poets and poetry

## Overview
> "Poetry is thoughts that breathe, and words that burn." â€”Thomas Gray

In this project, I will use the poet's database API (https://poetrydb.org/index.html) to allow users to search for specific poems and poets. I plan to create a keyword to rerun poems that deal with certain themes. My goal is to make this a source of learning and inspiration for users.

## Credits
For my own personal inspiration I will study the following sites:
- https://www.poetryfoundation.org/
- https://poets.org/
- https://poems.com/
