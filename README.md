A searchable webpage devoted to poets and poetry

In this project, I will use the poet's database API (https://poetrydb.org/index.html) to allow users to search for specific poems and poets. I plan to create a keyword to rerun poems that deal with certain themes. My goal is to make this a source of learning and inspiration for users.

For my own personal inspiration I will study the following sites:
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/
https://poets.org/
https://poems.com/
